# Huy's Totally-Not-A-Manager README

## How I operate

### Feedback

1. How do you like feedback - the medium (Slack, email, in-person, etc.)
> Personally, I like feedback in-person (over VC). I'm also open to having tricky conversations over Slack, but when I say I want to take it offline, I ask that you respect that. Oh, and like most, I don't love feedback/difficult conversations over Slack that start with a "Hey" and then allow time to pass. If you want to chat, and think it'll be uncomfortable, let's take it off Slack. Or send me your complete thought!
2. How do you like feedback - the routine like in 1:1s, or as-it-happens
> Timely feedback is always better for me -- just grab me!
3. How do you prefer to receive recognition? (public or private)
> I'm totally fine with public recognition but don't expect it!

### Goals and Support

1. What makes 1:1s most valuable for you?
> 1:1s are a time for me to voice what I'm worried about.
2. What are your goals for this year? And for the next three months?
> Build a cross-functional team of engineering and product leaders to support the goals of our campaign. Support the growth of those who report to me by pushing them out of their comfort zone and into new areas. At least 1 stretch project each quarter.
3. What do you need from your manager?
> I need help solving problems. I don't need help tracking against goals -- I just want clear expectations so I know where I stand and I want help solving specific problems that I come to you with. I will often start a conversation with "Here's what I'm looking for...".
4. From your team?
> I need clear communication (both up and down) -- tell me when you're struggling. Tell me when a deadline is slipping. Tell me when you need more support. And tell me when to back off.
5. From your peers? (outside the team)
> I expect clear and timely feedback -- if you disagree with my approach, or an action I took, tell me as soon as possible!
