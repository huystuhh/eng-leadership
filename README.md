# Fisher's Manager README

## How I operate

### Feedback

1. How do you like feedback - the medium (Slack, email, in-person, etc.)
> Personally, I like feedback in-person. I'm also open to having tricky conversations over Slack, but when I said I want to take it offline, I ask that you respect that.
2. How do you like feedback - routine like in 1:1s, or as-it-happens
> Timely feedback is always better for me -- just grab me!
3. How do you prefer to receive recognition? (public or private)
> I'm totally fine with public recognition but don't expect it!

### Goals and Support

1. What makes 1:1s the most valuable for you?
> 1:1s are a time for me to voice what I'm worried about.
2. What are your goals for this year? And for the next three months?
> In my role as an engineering leadership sponsor I want to continue to improve our back-of-house systems' reliability and simplicity and support Casper's growth in the wholesale 
3. What do you need from your manager?
> I need help solving problems. I don't need help tracking against goals -- I just want clear expectations so I know where I stand and I want help solving specific problems that I come to you with. I will often start a conversation with "Here's what I'm looking for...".
4. From your team? (this one is good if the 1:1 is with someone who manages people, but is typically relevant for IC’s, too)
> I need clear communication (both up and down) -- tell me when you're struggling. Tell me when a deadline is slipping. Tell me when you need more support. And tell me when to back off.
5. From your peers? (outside the team)
> I expect clear and timely feedback -- if you disagree with my approach, or an action I took, tell me as soon as possible!

### Expectations of folks who report to me

Please invest in your 1:1s -- it's your time. You own your 1:1, so it is my expectation is for you to come with a topic to discuss. Here are some ideas:
1. What are you worried about?
2. What's some work that you've done recently that you're proud of?
3. What's bothering you?
4. What's blocking you from meeting your goals?

I often will come with questions for you -- in particular, if there's an organizational or engineering focus shift, expect me to come and ask you about it.

Outside of 1:1s, I expect you to track progress against the OKRs you've written each quarter. We should have a doc where we're tracking those -- please leave comments in the doc letting me know where you're at with your key results. If you are having issues with one of them, leave a note, and we'll talk about it during our 1:1. If focuses/goals need to change, that's fine! Let's just keep an open dialogue. Not meeting a key result or having to change your objectives because of shifting company or engineering priorities is fine, not meeting your goals because you forgot about them isn't okay.

Everyone needs work/life balance, and my expectation is that everyone takes time off. The amount you take is up to you, but I advise folks to take 3-5 days per quarter. Make the most of your time off -- I will push you to turn off your email, Slack, and completely disconnect from work. I will lead by example here, and I expect folks to hold me accountable to that as well.

### What to expect of me as your manager

A weekly 1:1 (unless you specifically prefer a different cadence) where we’ll work on challenges, goals, and priorities to support you and play to your strengths. I'll always share what I'm working on -- you should never wonder what I'm doing! I'll also always try and share context from the greater engineering leadership and tech management team.

I strive to be direct and clear in my feedback and direction. When you come to me with an issue or challenge I'll try and ask what you're looking for: advice or coaching. You can think of coaching as having me try to point you in the right direction without giving you what I think the answer is. If I'm not giving you the right kind of help, just tell me!

If we leave our 1:1 and you feel like something was unclear, just ping me. Know that I never want to leave things hanging or have you leave a conversation feeling uncomfortable.

You can expect me to devote some time each 1:1 to growth topics -- this can take the form of a conversation on your role at Casper, your career goals (both short and long term), and ways I (and engineering leadership) at Casper help you meet those goals. I'll more than likely keep notes of these conversations so we can easily check-in on progress in the future.

If you disagree with something I do, come and talk to me. I'm always happy to talk through decisions.

And most importantly, you should expect no surprises from me. If I have feedback, I will always give it to you in a timely manner. Nothing should be a surprise by the time we get to reviews (whatever cadence that is on).
