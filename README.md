# Huy's Totally-Not-A-Manager README

## How I operate

### Feedback

1. How do you like feedback - the medium (Slack, email, in-person, etc.)
> I don't have much of a preference towards the medium in regards to Slack or in-person, both are great! Definitely not email though (do we still do that nowadays?). I feel socially awkward sometimes though, so if it's a particularly tricky conversation, I may go off video and use audio only.
2. How do you like feedback - the routine like in 1:1s, or as-it-happens
> Whenever, wherever, however! 1:1s or Slack is fine, and as soon as it comes up is a-okay.
3. How do you prefer to receive recognition? (public or private)
> I really appreciate public recognition, but I am bad at receiving it (as in, very awkwardly thanking people when it happens or just smiling and nodding). 

### Goals and Support

1. What makes 1:1s most valuable for you?
> Feedback on if I'm working on something with the wrong approach, taking too long, or just general brainstorming on a solution I hadn't thought of yet. Also to be informed of the happenings on the other parts of the company, since sometimes as an engineer you may not get big picture updates as it happens.
2. What are your goals for this year? And for the next three months?
> Help CTA make our MVP and be freaking awesome.
3. What do you need from your manager?
> If I seem underwater or taking too long on things, I may need a voice to pull me back since sometimes I can get tunnel visioned on a technical task.
4. From your team?
> Expertise and thoughts on ways to approach a problem/task if I'm doing it in a weird way. Also just positive vibes and goss.
>5. From your peers? (outside the team)
> Outside perspective I suppose on things that may seem weird that the team is doing (on a technical/engineering level or otherwise)
